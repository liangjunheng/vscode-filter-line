## Features

1. Filter line by input string (or not contain input string).
2. Filter line by input regular expression (or not match input regular expression).
3. Filter line by config file `filterline.json`(or `filterline.eoml`) in corresponding `.vscode` directory.

### Filter line by input string.

1. Open command palette (⇧⌘p) and type `filterline`, select `Filter Line By Input String` in the list.
2. Type a string and hit `<Enter>`.
3. The extension will output matching lines in a new file with postfix `.filterline.$(ext)` (e.g. `1.log` will generate file `1.log.filterline.log`).

### Large file mode

Since [vscode's limitation](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/31078), when filter large files (e.g. >= 50MB), vscode extension can not get the file name currently opened. But this extension provide an alternative. e.g. if you want to filter large file `~/log/file.log`, do follow steps below :

1. Create an empty file named `filterline` ( `~/log/filterline`) in the same directory with log file.
2. Try to filter the empty file `filterline`.
3. Now the extension will list all files in the same directory.
4. Choose the one (`~/log/file.log`) you want to filter. 


#### Config file type

1. There are 2 file types `filterline.json` and `filterline.eoml`. 
2. `eoml` is a simple config file format that created by me(`everettjf`), only for this project(`vscode-filter-line`) at present. For more information, please visit [eoml](https://github.com/everettjf/eoml).

#### Config file format type

There are 3 format types. As they are so simple, I will not describe them here. Please visit the demo directly :
1. `stringlist`: String list [json](demo/log0json/.vscode/filterline.json) or [eoml](demo/log0eoml/.vscode/filterline.eoml)
2. `regexlist`: Regular expressions list [json](demo/log1json/.vscode/filterline.json) or [eoml](demo/log1eoml/.vscode/filterline.eoml)
3. `general`: This is default if `type` is not specified. [json](demo/log2json/.vscode/filterline.json) or [eoml](demo/log2eoml/.vscode/filterline.eoml)
